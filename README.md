For the TheMovie Db you need to create a file called "keys.dart" over "/lib/utils/" and add the following with your key: 

```
part of app_movie;

class Keys {
  static final apiKey = 'YOUR API KEY';
}
```
To generate a new key you must create an account over [TheMovieDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/faq/api) and clicking the "API" link from the left hand sidebar within your account settings.

For Firebase, add your files under:

```

For signing the APK you need to create a file under:
```
android/key.properties
```

with the following dat:
```
keyAlias="your key alias"
storePassword="your store password"
keyPassword="your key password"
storeFile="path of you .keystore"
```
Your keystore goes under 
```000
